This addon was created for backpacking my Shaman in TurtleWow CC2. It assumes you are level 60.

I use this addon by creating a macro for /bpheal bound to mouse wheel up, and a macro for /bpbuff bound to mousewheel down. This way I can have my Warrior window focused and controlled using my keyboard, and my Shamans healing/buffing is controlled by mousing over his window in the background and scroling up/down

How to Use:
    Place the Backpacker folder in your Interface/AddOns/ directory.
    Log in to Turtle WoW.
    Enable the addon in the character selection screen (click "AddOns" in the bottom left).
