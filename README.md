This addon was created for backpacking my Shaman in TurtleWow CC2. It assumes you are level 60.

I use this addon by creating a macro for /bpheal bound to mouse wheel up, and a macro for /bpbuff bound to mousewheel down. This way I can have my Warrior window focused and controlled using my keyboard, and my Shamans healing/buffing is controlled by mousing over his window in the background and scroling up/down

How to Use:
    Place the Backpacker folder in your Interface/AddOns/ directory.
    Edit the Backpacker_Config.lua file with the desired Lesser Healing Wave ranks and values. These values are used in determining which rank of lesser healing wave to cast.
    Log in to Turtle WoW.
    Enable the addon in the character selection screen (click "AddOns" in the bottom left).
